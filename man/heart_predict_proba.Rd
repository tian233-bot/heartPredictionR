\title{Predict positive-class probability for heart prediction}
\usage{
heart_predict_proba(
  df,
  bundle = heart_load_bundle(),
  model = c("topk", "full", "logistic")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{New data (data.frame) with feature columns.}

\item{bundle}{A bundle from \code{\link[=heart_load_bundle]{heart_load_bundle()}}.}

\item{model}{Which model to use: "topk", "full", "logistic".}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of positive-class probabilities between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Supported models: "topk" (recommended), "full", "logistic".
For TopK: uses stored prepared recipe (prep_rf_full) to bake features,
selects stored top_feats columns, then predicts with rf_top_cv.
}
