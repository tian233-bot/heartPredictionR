\title{Predict heart disease probability (positive class)}
\usage{
heart_predict_proba(
  df,
  bundle = heart_load_bundle(),
  model = c("topk", "full", "logistic")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{New data (data.frame) with required feature columns.}

\item{bundle}{A bundle from \code{heart_load_bundle()}.}

\item{model}{Which model to use: \code{"topk"}, \code{"full"}, \code{"logistic"}.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of positive-class probabilities between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
Supported models:
\itemize{
\item \code{"topk"}: TopK random forest (recommended deployment model)
\item \code{"full"}: Full-feature random forest
\item \code{"logistic"}: Regularised logistic regression baseline
}
}
\details{
Implementation notes:
\itemize{
\item Inputs are validated and coerced using \code{heart_coerce_inputs()}.
\item Engineered features are added using \code{heart_add_features()}.
\item For \code{"topk"}, your saved model is a \code{caret} \code{train.recipe}
object, so prediction is done directly via \code{predict()} and the recipe
is handled internally (no manual \code{bake()} required).

\examples{
b <- heart_load_bundle()
x <- heart_example_data(include_outcome = FALSE, n = 5)
p <- heart_predict_proba(x, bundle = b, model = "topk")
head(p)
