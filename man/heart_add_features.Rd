\title{Heart prediction feature engineering (deployment-safe)}
\usage{
heart_add_features(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data.frame / tibble with at least \code{Age}, \code{RestingBP}, \code{Cholesterol}.}
}
\value{
A tibble with engineered columns appended.
}
\description{
Suggests three engineered features that are simple, interpretable, and stable:
\itemize{
\item \code{age_decade}: age binned to decades
\item \code{high_bp_flag}: 1 if \code{RestingBP >= 140} mm Hg, else 0
\item \code{high_chol_flag}: 1 if \code{Cholesterol >= 240} mg/dl, else 0
}
}
\details{
This function does not modify your original variables beyond numeric coercion.

\examples{
b <- heart_load_bundle()

out <- heart_add_features(newdata)
