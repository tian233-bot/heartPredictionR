Description: 
    heartPredictR provides a reproducible prediction toolkit for
    heart disease risk classification from tabular patient features, including
    demographics, symptoms, vital signs, and ECG/exercise-related indicators.
    The package ships a pre-trained model bundle and exposes deployment-safe
    APIs for inference and reporting. It wraps the workflow, including:
    (i) input validation, type coercion, and feature engineering for new data
        (age decade, high blood pressure flag, high cholesterol flag);
    (ii) loading a packaged model bundle containing trained classifiers and
         preprocessing objects;
    (iii) threshold-based prediction on new data, returning class labels
          (Presence/Absence) and optional positive-class probabilities, with
          support for multiple model backends (TopK random forest, full random
          forest, and regularised logistic regression via glmnet);
    (iv) model evaluation at fixed thresholds, including accuracy, precision,
         recall, F1-score, AUROC/AUPRC (if available), and Brier score;
    (v) calibration diagnostics using binned calibration tables and expected
        calibration error (ECE);
    (vi) model interpretation via feature importance, including permutation
         importance for random forests and aggregated absolute coefficients for
         one-hot encoded glmnet models;
    (vii) model comparison utilities that summarise performance across multiple
          metrics on labelled datasets.
